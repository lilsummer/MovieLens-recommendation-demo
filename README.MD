2.	Install Jupyter. http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html
3.	Install Pip. https://packaging.python.org/installing/
4.	Using pip to install numpy, pandas, sklearn libraries (See command in pip document)
5.	Put the notebook file (Recommendation.ipynb) and dataset file (u.data) to one of your directory.
6.	Open your terminal find that directory.
7.	Type command “jupitor notebook”.
8.	After the Jupiter notebook webpage opening, click the “Recommendation.ipynb”.
9.	Then you can start running this program step by step.

## Future work
1.  Apply more different approaches
2.  Apply larger dataset to make the result more accurate

## Improvement
1.  Try to optimize the k value of SVD approach for the prediction.
